# Python Projects

These are a couple of my python scripts.

2. [Grade tracker](https://github.com/TineshaErskine/python_codes/tree/master/grade_tracker)
    * A script that takes user input in the form of a course and the grade obtained. It creates, writes, and saves this in a txt file. It will then read the information and print the average grade for the courses.

3. [Random numbers list](https://github.com/TineshaErskine/python_codes/tree/master/random_numbers_list)
    * A script that generates 12 random numbers and saves them within a list. It will sort the list from lowest to highest, print the first eight elements, and then print the last four elements in the sorted. It then prints the fourth element in the sorted list and amount of even and odd numbers.
